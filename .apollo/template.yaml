  Success! Created rover-template at ${path}

  Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

    npm start
      Starts the subgraph.

    npm run dev
      Starts the subgraph with nodemon

    npm test
      Starts the test runner.

  There is a setup script if you want to add additional functionality (like mocking). We suggest that you begin by typing:

    cd ${path}
    npm install
    npm run setup <- If you want to run wizard to add mocking
    npm run start

  Note: You must have Node >=14.0 installed to use this template. If you don't have Node installed, head over to https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

  Happy hacking!
